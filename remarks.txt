Maybe every delay should have its own part?
50ms SDWN time - isn't it too much?
(fixed) BUS ERROR on setting a PWR CLR bit in MTC register
MPCLR in TU10 are several inverters with same function

Test:
NXM error using a MC1201.02 board with partially disabled RAM
DMA address bit 16,17 functionality
DMA byte transfer
Are AD lines 18..21 are permanently disabled?
