Swap most likely too small CPLD to small Cyclone FPGA devboard
Test if Quartus supports Cyclone IV
Make new board design based on existing
  Draw devboard as component
  Put it on board
  Connect all CPLD signals to FPGA board
  Remove CPLD and unnecessary components
  Reroute all signals to FPGA board
  Add FT245 for debug purposes
  
Test if Qbus drivers fits on board
Do all other todo steps marked in pcb file
