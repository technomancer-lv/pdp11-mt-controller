# pdp11-mt-controller
Magnetic tape drive controller that let's connect CM5300 tape drive to soviet made PDP-11 compatible computers.

At the moment this is only an idea. I'm studying DEC TM11 manuals nd schematics, I'm trying to find as much as possible information about soviet made tape drive controllers. There were Q-bus based quad boards that soviets made for Elektronika-60 and DVK computers, but seems that no board are found in full working condition.

I'm developing prototype board, based on Altera EPM570F256 CPLD to test basic things - Q-bus addressing, DMA and IRQ functionality, tape drive connectivity, available resources. There will be more info on this as soon as I'll finish prototype PCB and will make some simple logics design.
